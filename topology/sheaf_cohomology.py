"""
Sheaf Cohomology Module with Golay Gluing
==========================================
Repurposes Golay codes for sheaf cohomology and gluing data.
Implements Čech cohomology for assembly organization.

Key insight: Golay codes are perfect for encoding gluing conditions
between local patches (assemblies) because they:
- Provide exact error correction for overlap regions
- Have natural group structure (Mathieu group M₂₄)
- Match assembly sizes (24 cells)
